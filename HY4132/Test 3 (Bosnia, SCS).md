**Question 1**\
"UN responses to the Bosnian War resulted in the ethnic cleansing in Bosnia-Herzegovina (1992–1995)." Do you agree with this view?

****

**Essay 1**

*Introduction*

It is without doubt that the United Nations (UN)’ intervention in the Bosnian War from 1992–1995 was arguably one of the most significant and tragic failures in the history of peacekeeping. The UN’s response (through UNPROFOR) failed on nearly every level beyond providing some humanitarian relief. It was critically unable to protect the civilians in the designated safe areas. Its command structure was also chaotic, and its Department of Peacekeeping Operations was ill-equipped to handle such a violent crisis. The Bosnian War was–on all accounts–the UN’s “moral Waterloo”.

Yet, I still disagree with the above viewpoint to a great extent. Yes, the UN’s response, which I define as its efforts in peacekeeping, diplomacy, and provision of humanitarian aid, was fundamentally inadequate. Yes, the ethnic cleansing, which I define as the systematic forced removal of Bosniaks by Serb forces, was preventable. But to attribute the horrible atrocities in the region and genocide to the UN is wholly misleading. I believe that the UN’s response was deeply flawed, but the ethnic cleansing which was perpetuated was the result of deliberate Serbian policy and great power inaction in the Security Council (UNSC).

I first discuss the nature of the UN response. I then analyze how the UN’s failings may have contributed to ethnic cleansing. After which, I propose and defend the counterargument that the ultimate responsibility in the genocide lies not on the UN, but on the Serb forces. I conclude that the UN’s inaction enabled the ethnic cleansing, but did not produce them, and thus the ethnic cleansing was not a result of UN responses to the Bosnian War.

*Background and origins of the conflict*

Before anything, it is important to understand how the conflict originated. The war in Bosnia emerged from the internal collapse of Yugoslavia. After the death of President Josip Broz Tito in 1980, the country’s federal system massively weakened and ethnic nationalism resurfaced amongst its many republics.

In particular, Bosnia-Herzegovina was especially vulnerable as a diverse, multiethnic state of Bosniaks (Muslims, 43% of the population), Serbs (Eastern Orthodox, 31%), and Croats (Roman Catholic, 17%). When Bosnia declared independence in March 1992 after a referendum that was boycotted by the Serbs, Bosnian Serb forces–backed by Slobodan Milošević and the Yugoslav People’s Army (JNA for short)–quickly launched an offensive to seize territory. Out of nationalistic interest, their goal was to create a “Greater Serbia” that would be free of non-Serbs. Under Milošević, ethnic cleansing quickly became a deliberate strategy. The mass expulsion, rape, and murder of Bosniak and Croat civilians allowed the army to establish ethnically homogenous territories; ethnically Serbian territories. By late 1992, Serb forces were in control of roughly three quarters of Bosnia.

The United Nations was drawn into the crisis after its earlier involvement in the war in Croatia. It sought to immediately halt the violence and deliver humanitarian aid to affected civilians. In Resolution 713 of 1992, the Security Council (UNSC) imposed an arms embargo on all of Yugoslavia; later that year, it established UNPROFOR for Resolution 743, which was initially meant for Croatia but later expanded to Bosnia to facilitate the deployment of humanitarian convoys and monitor ceasefires in the region. Yet, from the start, the UN mission was critically constrained by not only an ambiguous mandate, but inadequate manpower, an the political divisions of some of its leading member states. The UN’s response was therefore simply a cautious and reactive effort to contain the chaos of the Bosnian War without overusing force.

*The UN’s response*

The UNPROFOR’s mission in Bosnia was a traditional Chapter VI mission, being was dependent on consent as well as the UN’s institutional culture of impartiality. However, this culture was ill-suited for a Bosnian War that featured clear aggressors and victims, and held in an environment which demanded rapid enforcement. To compound matters for the worse, its troops (from over thirty countries around the world) were lightly armed and chronically unfunded. For instance, to secure the six “safe areas” of Srebrenica, Bihac, Gorazde, Sarajevo, Tuzla, and Zepa, the UN Force Commander estimated a need for 34,000 troops, whereas the UNSC authorized only 7,600.

UN commanders on the ground therefore had the impossible task of delivering humanitarian aid whilst attempting to navigate among heavily armed and hostile factions. It can also be argued that there was no peace to keep: the force had been deployed into an active war where the warring parties (especially the Bosnian Serbs, under the command of Slobodan Milošević) had little interest in peace and viewed the UN as simply an obstacle.

Throughout the conflict, UN convoys were regularly blocked. UN troops were targeted by gunfire. UN peacekeepers were ordered not to retaliate as civilians were massacred. Therefore, despite Resolutions 819 and 824 creating the six “safe areas”, UNPROFOR had no capacity to enforce them, and so Serbian forces routinely shelled the safe areas and restricted aid that went in through convoys. Furthermore, the “safe areas” also led to a false sense of security among Bosniaks who gathered in them, only to die due to the failure of UN protection. As an example, in the “protected city” of Srebrenica in 1995, the Dutch battalion was unable to resist the Serbian advance, and 8,372 Bosniaks and Croats were massacred.

We can conclude that the UN’s passivity did allow ethnic cleansing to occur, but whether it resulted in the ethnic cleansing has to be examined later.

*Impact of the UNSC on the UN’s response*

I believe that it was the impasse of the member states of the UNSC which massively constrained the UN’s response.

Over the course of the war, the UNSC passed more than 70 resolutions related to the former Yugoslavia. These resolutions contained strong language that condemned the atrocities but were fundamentally contradictory in their directives. As aforementioned, while these directives invoked Chapter VII of the UN Charter (which allows for peace enforcement), they simultaneously demanded that UNPROFOR had to adhere to the traditional peacekeeping principles of impartiality in a war zone were there was no peace to keep.

This incoherence was perhaps directly a result of lack of political will and the deep divisions among the permanent members of the UNSC. A brief stakeholder analysis reveals that the United States pushed for a more aggressive military response which constituted of air strikes and the lifting of the UN arms embargo[^1] on the Bosnian government (to provide the poorly-armed Bosniaks with high-powered American weapons, which would reportedly balance the conflict), but was adamant about not committing its own ground troops to the war. On the other hand, as the primary troop-contributing nations, the United Kingdom and France feared that aggressive actions would provoke retaliation against their lightly armed peacekeepers. Therefore, they resisted efforts to further intervene in the conflict.

Effectively, this deadlock led to a highly-compromised “middle-way” approach, which constituted of deploying a humanitarian mission with neither the mandate nor military strength to stop the conflict. It was further complicated by the “dual-key” command system, which required approval from both UN and NATO officials for any air strikes, therefore creating a cumbersome process which hindered any decisive action.

The result was paralysis; as the Bosnian Serbs advanced and atrocities mounted, the UN peacekeepers were reduced to bystanders in a war that they were forbidden to fight.

*Ethnic cleansing was a deliberate Serbian policy*

We know that the UN was structurally unable to prevent ethnic cleansing from happening. Hoewver, to claim that the UN resulted in ethnic cleansing oversimplifies the conflict and effectively ignores the agency of the real perpetrators. The atrocities that were committed in Bosnia in the four years of war were, I argue, neither accidental nor the outcome of UN action in any way. Rather, they were the product of deliberate state and paramilitary policy. As mentioned earlier, the Bosnian Serb leadership envisioned a homogenous Republika Srpska and implemented it through systematic violence (this was later proven by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, established by Resolution 808 in 1993). The ethnic cleansing was a deliberate Serbian policy that was executed by Generals Karadžić, Mladić, and Milošević. And given that it was executed by the Bosnian Serb army, and not the United Nations, the responsibility for the genocide rests with the generals who ordered it and all the politicians who supported it, and not the peacekeepers who were sent in with too little money and too little agency to stop it.

*Conclusion*

In conclusion, the United Nations failed to prevent, but did not cause, ethnic cleansing. While its structural flaws and the lack of will among member states made the atrocities possible, it was eventually the Bosnian Serb forces who perpetrated it. The true responsibility therefore lay with nationalist leaders and the political paralysis of the international community.

[^1]: The UN’s arms embargo had further compounded the imbalance of power. Because Bosnian Serb forces had already controlled the Yugoslav army’s stockpiles, the embargo disproportionately weakened the Bosnian government’s ability to defend itself.

**Question 2**\
“ASEAN’s efforts in the South China Sea Dispute have been an absolute failure.” Do you agree with this view?

****

**Essay 2**

*Introduction*

I agree with this view to a great extent. Backed up by Sources A, B, C, D, and G, I believe that ASEAN has done little to protect its member states’ sovereignty in regards to the dispute.

In the past few decades, China has, effectively unopposed, continued to exert its nine-dash-line claim to 90% of the South China Sea. Meanwhile, ASEAN, while acting as a forum for nations to come together and discuss its strategy, has generally acted indecisively and unconcertedly, with uncertain efforts that have been doomed from the beginning. I posit that this situation has been caused by consensus paralysis, the non-interference principle, and lack of enforcement tools.

*Sources A, B, C, D, and G agree with the thesis to a great extent*

Sources A, B, C, D, and G agree that ASEAN’s efforts in the dispute have been a failure.

Source A is an article by the Institute of Defence and Strategic Studies in Singapore. It details that in response to the Mischief Reef incident of 1999, ASEAN was unwilling to confront China more strongly despite the fact that this was China’s second transgression; at a meeting that year, ASEAN only managed to obtain Beijing’s agreement to give “serious” and “earnest” consideration to the Philippine proposal of a new regional code of conduct. Furthermore, the Philippines Foreign Affairs Undersecretary, Lauro Baja Jr., mentioned that the Philippines did not receive community aid in protesting China’s continued occupation of the relief, saying that the Philippines was “an orphan in its campaign”.

It is true that ASEAN has struggled in uniting member states to stand up to affronts on other states’ sovereignities. This is compounded by the fact that nations in ASEAN have generally different geopolitical stances in regards to China: while many claimants to parts of the South China Sea (Vietnam, Philippines, Malaysia, and Brunei) wish for strong multilateral resistance to China, non-claimants such as Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, and Thailand have opted to prioritize economic ties with Beijing, and thus have blocked tough action. We can see this scenario expressed further in Source C, which is a cartoon from an article, depicting that ASEAN solidarity could have helped to hold off China; yet, in real life, when claimants such as Vietnam and Philippines attempt to stand up together to China, the other nations of ASEAN seem to flee, possibly not wanting to worsen their economic ties with China, who has brought about much investment in the region.

Furthermore, Source B also state that even though ASEAN foreign ministers and China’s Vice Foreign Minister finally signed a Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea in 2002, Philippines and Vietnam were still disappointed as they had pushed for a more binding document. However, ASEAN lacks enforcement power, and therefore (as Source B further states) China was also able to reject the Vietnamese proposal for the declaration to include a commitment not to build new structures–in recent years, China has continued to build and militarize the Spratlys and Paracels.

Sources A, B, and C show that this lack of interconnectedness and hesitation by ASEAN member states to defend others have contributed to consensus paralysis (since ASEAN operates on a consensus-based system, just one China-friendly state can possibly block collective action). Therefore, ASEAN has been structurally unable to mount a sizable, concerted effort to oppose China in the South China Sea. 

Source D, meanwhile, is an article that opines that Indonesia’s annual, multilateral workshops on conflict resolution have contributed to confidence building and the facilitation of contacts between regional states, but are “more notable for what they have not achieved”. This is unsurprising due to the aforementioned reason of differing geopolitical stances. Analyzing Source D also tells us that ASEAN countries are unable to agree on even the smallest details such as creating transparency. With this in mind, they cannot be expected to agree on more pressing details such as military action. Since ASEAN also does not have any binding enforcement tools (since the organization can neither impose sanctions nor enforce rulings), it has often opted for symbolic diplomacy, with talks substituting for concrete progress. For example, ASEAN forums keep dialogue open but have no enforcement power. Furthermore, as an example, the Code of Conduct negotiations (1999–present) have taken decades; even though Indonesia tried to accelerate talks in 2023 with a goal to finalize by 2026, progress is slow, with China preferring delays in order to consolidate its control. And if even minutiae cannot be agreed on, ASEAN’s efforts in the dispute can only ever be small in scale too. These small efforts would definitely pale in comparison to what China, a global behemoth, could put out, and therefore it is unexpected that ASEAN’s efforts have been a failure, with it not even being able to put together a binding regional Code of Conduct.

Source G also partly corroborates this opinion, with Kishore Mahbubani advising ASEAN not to get drawn into the U.S.–China conflict amid heightened geopolitical tensions. Mahbubani thinks that public diplomacy (ASEAN, etc.) is unsuccessful, whereas private diplomacy (bilateral talks) has been very successful. This is also because of the relatively weak power of ASEAN, which is also built on a non-interference policy, where members generally avoid “taking sides” even when sovereignties of other nations are violated. Due to ASEAN’s consensus diplomacy, it has historically refrained from taking concrete measures to stand up to China, and therefore it is unsurprising that Mahbubani thinks that private diplomacy would be more successful. In fact, claimants have been increasingly turning to external powers (U.S, Japan, Australia, etc.) for military and diplomatic support, with ASEAN’s imagine as the region’s “central security actor” having been eroded.

Together, these sources collectively illustrate the relative weakness of ASEAN compared to China, and how ASEAN’s efforts have therefore been a failure.

*Source F partly disagrees with the thesis*

Source F is an article by Rodolfo C. Severino, former Secretary-General of ASEAN. It commends ASEAN’s provision of negotiating strength, and illustrates how ASEAN, as a group, has held discussions with China on the South China Sea in a number of forums. The article also references the joint communiques made in annual ASEAN Ministerial Meetings.

Source F may seem like it is heaping praise on ASEAN, but it was, after all, written by a former Secretary-General, so its accuracy is dubious. Furthermore, it only states that ASEAN has put in effort to manage the situation in the South China Sea, which is true, but provides no evaluation of whether it has been successful or not. However, the Declaration of the Code of Conduct is, after all, still a declaration and not the actual Code of Conduct, which has not been completed yet. Furthermore, China has proven that it is able to not only bypass non-concrete measures but also circumvent even legally-binding measures such as the Hague Tribunal (in Philippines v. China, 2016) ruling that China’s nine-dash line was illegal under UNCLOS and found China to be in violation of Philippine sovereign rights; China rejected the verdict and continued its construction and militarization of artificial islands in the region anyway). Without a legally binding, actual Code of Conduct, ASEAN seems powerless to curb China’s infringement on sovereignty and its nine-dash line claim. Therefore, while Source F has helpfully provided an overview of ASEAN’s discussions and multilateral fora, it has not shown whether they have been helpful–in fact, they have not been.

*Conclusion*

Taken as a set, the sources conclusively reveal the fact that ASEAN’s efforts in the South China Sea have been a failure. The dispute has exposed the limits of the organization’s consensus-based diplomacy: even though ASEAN has kept its channels open and perhaps helped to prevent direct war, it has effectively failed to either restrain Chinese expansion or protect the sovereignty of its members. The ASEAN Way, normally a source of peace, has now become a constraint when dealing with the South China Sea–producing unity in form but paralysis in substance. Until ASEAN develops stronger internal cohesion and a binding regional mechanism through the completion and ratification of the Code of Conduct, its role in the South China Sea dispute will ultimately remain symbolic and its efforts, complete failures.

**Personal comments**
1. I should have used more footnotes. That would have helped in both essays.
2. The signposting (in the last paragraph of the introduction in Essay 1) is clear, and works well. I should adopt it, with discretion, for all future essays. (Even though, I note, Halbach (2019) recommends against it.)
3. I should have advanced my argument in Essay 2 with more nuance by paying attention to the non-insignificant role played by ASEAN's diplomacy. That would have gotten me an A grade, I think. Of course, I was also rushing it, which resulted in a number of very avoidable and noticeable spelling errors (I will have to use the spellcheck feature in future essays).
4. I need to manage my time better, and try to spend 5 minutes or so drafting an essay plan before I start. Perhaps I can write the signposting paragraph immediately after planning. I should also allocate a few minutes to post-writing proofreading.
5. On the whole, I hope for a marked improvement in the quality of my graded submissions for history courses in Year 5 and beyond.
