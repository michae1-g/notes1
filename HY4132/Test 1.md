*Introduction*

From the Vespasian-era Roman siege of the Holy City that expelled much of its Jewish population, to the Crusades and successive Muslim reconquests, Jerusalem and the surrounding West Bank have been a minefield of struggles for millennia. The modern Arab-Israeli Conflict was therefore not an isolated outbreak of violence; rather, it was a continuation of these historical animosities, now intensified by several nationalist and geopolitical factors that made the situation difficult for the United Nations to control through its peacekeeping efforts and resolutions.

In this context, between 1948 and 1979, the conflict remained unresolved due less to any United Nations ineffectiveness than to two deeper problems: post-Holocaust Jewish immigration and the resulting Palestinian displacement, and the concerted refusal of Arab states to recognize the legitimacy of Israel. The AI outline gives a helpful chronological summary of events but provides a shallow analysis of the UN’s actions by calling them ineffective without considering the cause of their limitations.

*The First Arab-Israeli War and the Nakba*[^1]

Fundamentally, the intractability of the conflict stemmed from the mass influx of Jewish immigrants into the mandate of Palestine following World War II and the resulting displacement of Palestinians during the Nakba.

After the Holocaust, hundreds of thousands of Jewish survivors immigrated to Palestine, with their aspirations for a sovereign homeland clashing with the majority-Arab population. As a result, the native Palestinians began viewing the growing Jewish population as a settler-colonial intrusion[^2] backed by Zionism.

The UN attempted to resolve this issue through Resolution 181 which partitioned Palestine into separate Jewish and Arab states. The AI rightly notes that Arab nations rejected the plan and immediately launched a war when Israel declared independence; however, it implies that the UN’s “failure” to enforce the plan was a missed opportunity for reconciliation. This overlooks that the plan itself had already been viewed as illegitimate by most Palestinians and other Arabs, who thought it granted a disproportionately large portion of land to a Jewish minority. Henceforth, no amount of UN enforcement could have compelled Arab states to accept Israel’s colonial seizure.

This situation worsened when, after Israel’s victory in the First Arab-Israeli War (1948), it occupied more territory than originally assigned under the UN partition. Consequently, around 800,000 Palestinians became refugees in the Nakba, scattering communities across neighboring states, which entrenched Arab-Israeli tensions. The UN created UNRWA[^3] and the Conciliation Commission through Resolution 194 to address the refugee issue, including the right of return. However, Israel’s refusal to allow return limited these efforts politically. Clearly, these limitations were not due to UN ineffectiveness, with Israel’s inaction also a result of the inbuilt non-binding nature of General Assembly resolutions.

Moreover, the Palestinian Liberation Organization, established in 1964, vigorously sought to strengthen Palestinian national identity and openly supported armed resistance against Israel, which deepened existing anti-Israel resentment among Palestinians and their Arab neighbors. In short, throughout the thirty-year-long conflict, the very existence of Israel was wholly unacceptable to the Arab world.

*Arab Rejection of Israel*

This brings us to the second, and arguably more decisive, reason for the conflict’s persistence: the staunch unwillingness of Arab states to recognize Israel, causing the consequent political stalemate. The AI treats Arab rejectionism as a reaction to the Six-Day War in 1967 and highlights the “Three No’s[^4]” of the Khartoum Resolution, certainly a noteworthy event that demonstrated the Arab League’s hardline stance of unwavering hostility against Israel. However, their rejection had begun with the aforementioned refusal to accept the 1947 UN partition and continued with their coordinated invasion of Israel in 1948. These early actions set the tone for decades of hostility and created a political environment in which multilateral negotiations were very difficult.

The AI also overlooks that this stance suppressed Arab-Israeli diplomacy even after wars, which made UN efforts at peacekeeping and mediation in vain. Following Israel’s overwhelming victory in 1967, the UN passed Resolution 242 which called for Israeli withdrawal from occupied territories in exchange for peace and recognition by Arab states. This resolution was deliberately ambiguous about the extent of withdrawal, which was a compromise intended to gain broader support for it; however, Arab states interpreted it as requiring full Israeli withdrawal before any negotiations could begin, which Israel rejected.

Both Israel and Arab states also questioned the UN’s credibility. In 1975, a General Assembly resolution equating Zionism with racism made Israel doubt the UN’s neutrality; Arab states also increasingly perceived the UN as biased in favor of Israel’s Western allies, like the United States. Consequently, even well-intentioned UN resolutions and peacekeeping missions, such as UNTSO and UNEF II, could not overcome the fundamental lack of political will and distrust among Israel and Arab states themselves. This also meant that ceasefires, which the UN sought to upheld, could only ever be temporary and effective in the short-term.

It is true that Egypt became a notable exception. After the costly Yom Kippur War of 1973, President Anwar Sadat reassessed Egypt’s position toward Israel; facing economic stagnation, he pursued diplomacy which led to the Camp David Accords (1978), brokered by U.S. President Jimmy Carter. The AI attempts to portray American shuttle diplomacy as superior to the UN’s efforts but disregards the mutual distrust that had rendered UN mediation ineffective. Its declining credibility also gave the U.S. leverage, allowing the U.S. to bypass the UN. Importantly however, this major breakthrough still only occurred when Egypt became amenable to recognizing Israel. This reaffirms that Arab political will was the barrier to peace, not UN effectiveness.

*United Nations Performance in Context*

The UN’s inability to resolve the conflict was also due to its structural limitations, influenced somewhat by Cold War dynamics. Nonetheless, when it was given opportunities to mediate ceasefires and encourage diplomacy, the UN frequently succeeded.

At its inception in 1945, non-binding General Assembly resolutions, veto power in the Security Council, and lack of enforcement measures had been built into the UN Charter to encourage cooperation among member states. Since the UN was also limited in budget and manpower, its peacekeeping missions and resolutions had restricted scope and mandate. Furthermore, as the AI suggests, the conflict had also been a proxy background between the U.S. and USSR[^5] which complicated compromise. When operating within this bipolar world order, the UN’s efforts were made secondary to their competition.

Despite its limits, the UN generally succeeded in mediating ceasefires and facilitating diplomacy. UNTSO[^6] was deployed rapidly in 1948 and fulfilled its specific mandate to uphold the ceasefire in Palestine until 1956. UNTSO mediators had also helped to end the First War in 1949, and although they were ultimately unable to enforce the General Armistice Agreements[^7], they had not been mandated to. UNTSO also served as the only consistent communication channel between Israel and Arab states in a region with no diplomatic ties; given the sustained hostility, UNTSO’s consistency in this regard was remarkable and its actions exceeded its mandate. Similarly, UNEF II[^8], established after the Yom Kippur War, helped stabilize the Sinai region which led up to the Camp David process.

The AI describes the UN’s efforts here as short-term successes that failed to solve the root causes of this conflict, which is a shallow analysis. UN resolutions were never designed to “solve” the conflict; with limited budget and mandate, their goal was only to monitor and mediate. The UN achieved these in an incredibly hostile political climate and therefore was undoubtedly effective within its parameters.

*Conclusion*

In conclusion, the Arab-Israeli Conflict remained unresolved not because of United Nations ineffectiveness, but due to ideological hostility between Zionism and Arab nationalism, refusal of Arab states to recognize Israel, and the inbuilt limitations of the UN. The AI has helpfully provided an overview of events and UN actions, but its analysis gave undue weight to non-fundamental UN “failures”. In reality, the UN, constrained though it was, acted consistently and constructively throughout the conflict, and cannot be blamed for the conflict’s persistence.
