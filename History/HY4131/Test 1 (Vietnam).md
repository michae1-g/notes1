In general, the documents do not show convincingly that American intervention in Indochina was fully in the aim of securing the independence of the Republic of Vietnam, as there were also other strategic and geopolitical motivations at play (seen in Documents C, D, and E) which ‘forced’ America’s hand.

Documents A and B generally support the hypothesis. They collectively imply that the United States intervened in Indochina with the primary aim to assist the South Vietnam government in establishing a strong state and in their defense efforts against North Vietnam.

In Document A, President Eisenhower first mentions American assistance in helping South Vietnamese citizens relocate from Communist-controlled areas; a humanitarian justification which portrays U.S. aid in support of people who reject Communism. This aligns with the broader American policy strategy on Vietnam around that time (recall that six months earlier in April 1954, Eisenhower had also proposed the domino theory). In the document, Eisenhower next emphasizes America’s intention for South Vietnam to become a “strong, viable state” that was “capable of resisting attempted subversion or aggression through military means” — the aggression likely to come from North Vietnam. It can be inferred that the U.S. wanted South Vietnam to be politically and militarily strong in order to create a stable, anti-Communist government that was able to deal with North Vietnamese threats, given the volatile nature of the 1950s. From these points, it can be conclusively seen that the letter was, at face value, showing that American intervention was to secure South Vietnamese independence by assisting them militarily. However, there is a more vague section of Document A — in that it ties American support to Diem’s government undertaking reforms. Of course, the United States was aware of South Vietnam’s internal weaknesses, and wanted to ensure stability; however, this also suggests that the United States wished to shape South Vietnam’s political direction. At that time, South Vietnam needed America’s money for projects such as the Strategic Hamlet Program (of Diem), to rebuild infrastructure, and for military preparations against North Vietnam’s aggression. America would provide it — as seen in the document — but only if South Vietnam underwent reforms that suited the United States’s agenda there. As a result, the document also implies that the United States was forcing Diem’s hand to undertake reforms in government and to secure a stable, anti-Communist regime that aligned with its Cold War strategy rather than simply ensuring South Vietnam’s independence in its own right, and so here the document is slightly vague. However, overall, Document A still implies that American intervention in Indochina was primarily to secure South Vietnam’s independence.

Document B clearly states that America wished to assist South Vietnam to “protect its people and preserve its independence”, stating that America will increase its assistance for the defense effort of Vietnam. The document also seems to give assurance to Diem that if North Vietnam was to stop further aggression (meaning that South Vietnam’s independence was secured), the United States would withdraw defense aid from South Vietnam and allow Diem to have full control over the economic and military policy of South Vietnam. The defense aid was apt, seeing that in 1961, the Viet Cong had already been actively fighting against South Vietnam forces, and Kennedy had sent ‘advisors’ to South Vietnam in preparation for a large-scale North Vietnamese attack. In the document, Kennedy even emphasized that American assistance was simply a measure to ensure peace and stablity in the region. As such, the document fully reflected that United States intervention was a defense of South Vietnam’s independence.

Together, Documents A and B suggest that the United States’s primary aim of assisting, and intervening in, South Vietnam was to secure its independence and to prevent its people from getting trapped in communist ideology and rule. However, one must also examine the context and audience of the documents. They were both directed to Diem, meaning that the United States would have had to appease him and make him trust the United States as a loyal ally and willing to assist in South Vietnam’s defense, so the actual intentions of the United States might not actually be what was written in those documents.

Document D, by itself, is somewhat vague; although it does state that the United States aimed to preserve the independence of South Vietnam, the document also suggests that United States involvement in Indochina was also to maintain its dominance in Asia and contain communism. First, in the document, Defense Secretary McNamara states that the United States has “no designs” on Vietnam’s resources and that its presence was purely for the defense of free nations, preserving democracy and independence. He emphasized also that America’s goal is not conquest, but to allow South Vietnam to remain independent; therefore reinforcing the official U.S. position that intervention was about protecting South Vietnam from communist expansion. However, one could notice the careful wording of McNamara in his speech (as in, no specific policy ideas and simply restating the U.S’s official position), likely because he was aware of growing criticism around the war — by 1964, American involvement had been escalating and many questioned whether South Vietnam could actually survive without American military support. Now, in the second half of the document, McNamara begins to acknowledge Vietnam’s strategic location, stating that its “location across east-west air and sea lanes” was central, and that if South Vietnam was to fall to the communists, the security of the United States would be threatened. Here, he implies that losing Vietnam would threaten U.S. credibility, therefore destabilizing the region. This contradicts the earlier claims in Documents A and B that U.S. intervention was purely about defending the sovereignty of Vietnam and suggests that U.S. involvement was also about preventing communism from controlling Southeast Asian countries, thus harming American credibility and status as a world power.

Document C and E strongly challenge the hypothesis, implying that the United States was aiding South Vietnam due to its own strategic motivations in the region.

Document C was written by Mao, the Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party, and directed to a delegation of those who wanted liberation of South Vietnam from American ‘control’, and so is inherently biased as he would have to appease the liberation faction. China was also competing with the Soviet Union for influence over the communist world and Vietnam was naturally a key battleground. However, Mao does raise a valid point that Diem was a “lackey” of the United States. It is true that Diem’s regime was widely unpopular in South Vietnam, and had to rely on American aid to survive. Through this aid, as seen partly in Document A, the United States was able to shape South Vietnamese policy, thereby somewhat controlling Diem and his government. Mao also denounced U.S. intervention as “imperalism” and a colonial effort, claiming further that Diem was a U.S. puppet who ruled with repression (the latter was true), finally portraying the war as a “patriotic struggle for liberation”. He asserted to the liberation faction of South Vietnam that true independence would come from fighting U.S. imperialism. Through this, Mao suggested in the document that South Vietnam’s independence was conditional on American support — thereby making it, interestingly, less of a true sovereign nation, and more of a Cold War client state which the U.S. had to control to curb the tide of communism in the region.

Document E, meanwhile, was a Johnson speech immediately following the Gulf of Tonkin incident, where a naval confrontation occured between North Vietnamese forces and the U.S. Navy. Here, in the document, it is apparent that justification for American involvement has shifted. Johnson speaks not about simply preserving the independence of South Vietnam; instead, he calls for military action to defend American credibility and its commitments in Vietnam. His request that Congress pass a resolution to “(support) freedom (and) defense of peace in Southeast Asia” also further confirmed that the United States wished to intervene in South Vietnam to stop communism from spreading to other countries in the broader region (and thereby preserving America’s image as defenders of democracy); no longer was it involved simply to preserve South Vietnamese independence. Naturally, the Gulf of Tonkin resolution which followed paved the way for full scale American military involvement in Vietnam and showed that by 1964 the war was no longer just about Vietnam, but about U.S. prestige and global influence.

Together, Documents C and E imply that the United States, through its strategic program of aid to South Vietnam, wished to control the South Vietnamese government and its policies, and that the U.S. acted in Vietnam to preserve democracy in Southeast Asia, rather than simply to secure the independence of South Vietnam.

In conclusion, a balanced evaluation of the documents imply that the United States acted in Vietnam not just to secure the independence of South Vietnam, but to control Diem and his government to enact reforms and policies that suited America’s broader goal of containing communism in the region. In private, the United States might have assured Diem that their goal was just to save South Vietnam from the communist North and therefore aided him, however, in practice, its decisions and use of conditions in its aid ultimately controlled Diem’s government to make decisions that the U.S. was in favor of. By 1964, with the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, United States troops were beginning to be introduced and the Vietnam War shifted not just for protection of South Vietnam but for the destruction of North Vietnam and communism in general; in essence, ideological warfare instead of simply preserving South Vietnam’s independence.
