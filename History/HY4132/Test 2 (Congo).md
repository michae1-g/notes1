**Essay**

*Introduction*

In June 1960, the people of the Congo were ready to forge their own path forward as a nation on the rise. As Prime Minister of the newly independent nation, Patrice Lumumba proclaimed that the Congolese had won their independence in a “persevering and inspired struggle”, having suffered their share of humiliation through eighty years of oppressive Belgian colonial rule and abuse which took the forms of forced labor, political persecution, and senseless shootings. However, following the mutiny of Force Publique soldiers in July that year, the Belgium government deployed its own troops to “restore peace”; eventually, the provinces of Katanga and South Kasai seceded from the Congo with support of the Belgians. Five years of infighting followed in what is now known as the Congo Crisis before being ended by Mobutu’s assumption of unilateral rule.

Even though certain elements of the Cold War rivalry between the U.S. and USSR were evident in the conflict, the clash between these two superpowers essentially became a non-factor after Fall 1961, where the U.S. broke with erstwhile allies to join the USSR in voting for the United Nations Security Council to authorize UN troops to expel foreign mercenaries in Katanga. On the other hand, elements of decolonization struggles were very much present in the power struggle that ensued after Congolese independence, where Belgium failed to adequately prepare Congo for independence, and supported secessionist efforts and led to leaders of different provinces clashing against each other, creating instability and political volatility. However, like most historical decolonization crises, the Congo Crisis ended after a stable government was created once again. Therefore, the 1960-65 Congo Crisis was much more a crisis of decolonization than one of the Cold War.

*In Support of “Decolonization”*

Multiple sources support the Congo Crisis being “a crisis of decolonization”, with Belgian intervention eventually allowing power to decentralize and fall into the hands of secessionist politicians like Tshombe and rebels including Mobutu, causing a power vacuum in Congo. Its haste to concede independence and failure to adequately prepare Belgian Congo for independence were also central factors in causing the crisis.

First, the Belgians were hasty to concede Congolese independence. Around the world, many nations such as India and Pakistan became independent before the end of the 1940s, and multiple others gained independence in the 1950s. It was only after anti-colonial sentiment among Belgian youths and the rise of effective leader Lumumba that the Belgian government finally conceded independence. Furthermore, it was evident that their concession was not whole-hearted, with King Badouin giving, on Congo’s Independence Day, a paternalist speech praising Belgian colonialism. In the years before independence, Belgium had also made few steps to ensure that strong bureaucratic practices and systems would be created in Congo; effectively, the leaders of the Congo had to start from scratch.

Second, the Force Publique mutiny gave Belgium an opportunity to intervene and bring about the secessions of the resource-rich province of Katanga, as well as the province of South Kasai. Feuille d’Avis de Neuchatel, a Swiss regional newspaper, covered General Janssens’ response on the mutiny of the Force Publique, where Janssens faced a statue of King Léopold II and told the statue that the Congolese had betrayed him. General Janssens was the commander-in-chief of the Congolese army, the Force Publique and precipitated the mutiny of Congolese soldiers in the army on July 5 by stating that their status “after independence” would be the same as that “before independence”. This statement only served to enrage the Congolese troops, especially so since Prime Minister Lumumba’s June 30 speech had mentioned the Congolese people’s oppression and suffering under the Belgian colonial occupation. Perhaps Janssens could have deliberately wanted to enrage his Congolese soldiers into mutiny so that Belgium could reasonably take back military control of Congo, given his strong anti-Africanization belief which essentially implied that he was against Congo’s independence.

Even though Janssens was promptly fired by Lumumba, violence still spread to other bases; due to the murders of Belgian officers, the Belgian government deployed its own troops into Congo to restore peace without the permission of either Joseph Kasavubu, the President of Congo, nor Lumumba, the Prime Minister.

In response, Congo’s government appealed directly to the United Nations to provide troops and demanded the removal of Belgian troops. This was ultimately partly successful, as the United Nations established the Organisations des Nations Unies au Congo (ONUC) and called for the withdrawal of all Belgian troops. In this instance, the U.S. wanted to protect law and order in the nation and pre-empt the Soviets without overtly supporting Belgium, a former colonial power, whereas the USSR were glad that a UN force would be replacing Belgium, a NATO member. Although their goals in the region were different, they still agreed to create the ONUC which replaced Belgian troops in the country, demonstrating cooperation between these superpowers during the Cold War.

Even after the establishment of the ONUC, Belgium still continued to attempt to weaken the destabilized Congo. As an academic journal from 2005 mentions, on 16 July, the Belgian government recognized the de facto independence of the resource-rich province of Katanga, and a few days later, Belgium decided to create the Missi Technique Belge, an organization that would supply assistance to the breakaway province. It can be inferred that the Belgian government had supported Katanga knowing that Moise Tshombe was a strong military leader and thus a capable ally, and that the loss of Katanga would strand Congo economically since Katanga was the richest province in the nation. The Belgians’ attempts to weaken Congo continued after, where they supported the secession of the South Kasai province in August.

As Soviet leader Khrushchev puts it in his speech before the UN General Assembly in September 1960, Belgium’s forced entry of their troops into the Congo was a way to “deprive (Congo) of its freedom”, and this continued through the “senseless attempt” to destabilize Congo by “(detaching) by force its richest province, Katanga”. Even though Khrushchev would have not been kind to the Belgian government in any case since the USSR was politically opposed to Belgium, a NATO state, his statement still holds some truth. The loss of Katanga, a province that was extremely rich in copper, cobalt, uranium, and other precious minerals, effectively crippled the Congolese national economy since tax revenue went to the government of Katanga, not a central state. Later on, this newfound wealth would increase the power of secessionist politician Moise Tshombe, who became a powerful Belgian ally. Of course, Belgium was also involved in the murder of Lumumba in early 1961, which created a power vacuum in Congo.

To prosper (or at least, survive), any newly independent country had to stay peaceful and avoid internal warfare. Belgium’s support of the Katanga and South Kasai secessions and governments meant that they were able to easily ally with the leaders of those states and ensured that Congo’s economy was left in a dire state.

*In Support of “the Cold War”*

It is also true that the Cold War rivalry between the U.S. and USSR caused the intervention of the two superpowers in the Congo Crisis, but it was not paramount. In the crisis, the U.S, together with Belgium, orchestrated the removal of Lumumba; meanwhile, the USSR recognized Gizenga’s government as the “sole legitimate” government of Congo. These actions certainly exacerbated the crisis, but they pale in comparison with Belgium’s intervention.

A cable from a top American diplomat to the CIA chief in Léopoldville in August 1960 mentioned that if Lumumba were to continue to hold high office, “chaos” and, in the worst case, a “Communist takeover of the Congo” could happen, and therefore the diplomat advocated for Lumumba’s removal. It is true that the CIA, in concert with Belgium, then backed President Joseph Kasavubu to remove Lumumba from office, and pushed for his transfer to Katanga. It is also true that Lumumba was killed in 1961 by Tshombe’s men in Katanga.

However, the Church Committee report in 1975 found no evidence that the United States had been involved in Lumumba’s killing. It could be deduced that the CIA had only meant to transfer power onto one of the U.S’s allies such as Mobutu and did not expect rebel forces to execute Lumumba. Furthermore, Lumumba’s death came four months after Colonel Mobutu’s coup d’état in September 1960 and assumption of power; even if he had not been killed, it was unlikely that he would have been able to re-assume power in Congo.

The USSR also recognized Gizenga’s Free Republic of the Congo as the “sole legitimate government” of the Congo, but they provided no aid, and ultimately Gizenga’s government was peacefully dissolved soon after.

Lastly, in the Fall of 1961, the U.S. also broke with its erstwhile allies of Belgium, Britain, France, Portugal, South Africa, and the Central African Federation to join the USSR in voting in the Security Council to authorize UN troops to expel foreign mercenaries in Katanga, and after the vote, the U.S. did not appear to be in conflict with the USSR in Congo throughout the duration of the crisis.

Ultimately, the Crisis also ended due to U.S. interference: in November 1965, backed by a U.S. funded and trained national army, Mobutu staged a definitive coup and took ultimate control of Congo. Compared to Belgium’s intervention in the Crisis, the conflict between the U.S. and USSR was much less important throughout the Crisis.

*Conclusion*

In summary, the Congo Crisis was undoubtedly much more “a crisis of decolonization” than “a crisis of the Cold War”. U.S. and USSR actions were significant in leading to the power struggle and ultimate death of Lumumba but compared to Belgium’s haste to concede independence and failure to adequately prepare Belgian Congo for independence as well as its support of secessionist leaders such as Moise Tshombe, they were much more minor. Decolonization issues and Belgian intervention had resulted in a militarily weak Congo, a demographically unstable Congo, and an economically troubled Congo. Even though the country was endowed with exceptional natural resources, Belgium’s lack of support and destabilization of Congo ultimately left the Congolese government vulnerable and led to the power vacuum that caused the Congo Crisis.

**Personal comments**\
It was foolish for me to have included hypotheses like "Janssens could have ... into mutiny" and "the CIA had ... Lumumba". I'll have to avoid such guesses (which cannot be substantiated by evidence) in the future.
