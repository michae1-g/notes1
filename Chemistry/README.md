# Chemistry notes
I've always been, relative to my peers, subpar at Chemistry. By actually doing the homework and practicing a bit I started to get better at the subject in Year 4. The Year 5 courses (especially CM5131) are rough, I think, but with practice and effort a good grade can definitely be obtained.

## Course index
| Course code | Course title | Units | 
| :---- | :-------- | :---- 
| CM4131 | Principles of Inorganic Chemistry and Structure of Matter | 4 | 
| CM4132 | Chemical Kinetics and Equilibria | 4 |
| [CM5131](CM5131/) | Organic Chemistry | 4 |
| [CM5132](CM5132/) | Thermodynamics and Electrochemistry | 4 |
