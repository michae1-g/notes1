# Chemistry notes
I've always been subpar at Chemistry. However, once I began consistently doing the homework and focused revision, my grades improved noticeably in Year 4. The Year 5 courses, particularly CM5131, are definitely tough, but with consistent work, achieving a strong grade is still very possible.\
I have made notes and flashcards for CM5131 and CM5132, aided by the Department's lesson slides and handouts.
