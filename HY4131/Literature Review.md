**Review**

*Introduction*

This literature review will examine the influence of the Cold War and its geopolitics on the establishment, growth, and decline of NASA, drawing on the works of Koman (1994), Launius (2003), and Werth (2004). First, this review explores how the space race between the United States and the USSR altered NASA’s funding and perception. Second, it analyzes NASA’s role as a strategic tool during the Cold War as both a symbol of ideological and technological superiority and a consolidated government agency spearheading development in aerospace technology. Last, it assesses the long-term budgetary and infrastructural challenges that NASA faced after the end of the Apollo program.

*The Genesis of NASA*

Before the creation of NASA, there had been many proposals to create a U.S. national aeronautics agency. Werth (2004) highlights the proposal of a “UN Air and Space Force”, containing “hundreds of patrolling spacecraft, to put Soviet imperialism at bay”. However, it is apparent that proposals like these only gained traction after the impressive and unprecedented 1957 launch of Sputnik, which prompted a similarly unprecedented response from American policymakers.

Koman (1994) argues that Sputnik was a wake-up call as it highlighted the USSR’s newfound capabilities in space and their potential for military dominance. According to her, the launch made the American public “fully aware of the Soviet potential” in spaceflight. Powered by “200,000 pounds of thrust”, the success of Sputnik meant that the Soviet Union had the sole ability to deliver a nuclear warhead across the globe. As Werth (2004) explains—“the country that could launch the heaviest satellites had the most powerful rockets”—the race to develop long-range weapons was intrinsically linked to advancements in aerospace and missile technology. This realization dramatically increased America’s vulnerability to a possible Soviet attack, and instilled a deep sense of “shock” among American policymakers, pushing them to “speed up to close the “missile gap””, says Koman (1994). The launch also marked the erosion of the U.S’s previous dominance, which had been backed by the “twin securities” of monopolistic possession of nuclear armaments and extensive multilateral economic assistance, as Koman (1994) mentions. Thus, catching up in the space race quickly became a national imperative for the United States. This led to President Eisenhower’s swift decision (working together with Congress) to establish a national aeronautics agency—NASA—in July 1958. Here, Werth (2004) interestingly quotes Frank Gibney, a former aide to the U.S. House Committee on Science and Astronautics, as mentioning that NASA was created for defense purposes, not for “(discovering) the origins of our solar system”, as such an urge, “however noble, is not a firm base for national policy”. Koman (1994) also further notes that NASA’s early months were characterized by the immediate consolidation of America’s “diverse programs and interests in space exploration”, changing from a fragmented approach (with multiple small groups and agencies handling spaceflight) to a government-backed, centralized federal effort with the goal of securing a technological edge over the USSR. This centralization facilitated NASA's rapid expansion during the Apollo programs, driven by increased government funding and Cold War imperatives such as the heightened importance of space exploration to national security.

*NASA’s Development and Decline*

As an example, the Apollo program, NASA’s defining achievement, was a direct and dramatic response by President Kennedy to Cold War pressures. In the process, this program also caused NASA to expand significantly and indirectly led to its momentum slowing greatly after its culmination.

Launius (2003) argues that Kennedy did not have a “refined approach” to winning the Cold War (compared to Eisenhower). He viewed each confrontation with the Soviets as an “existential battle”; each setback as one of “spectacular proportions”, prompting him to pursue dramatic, high-stakes responses such as Apollo. Eisenhower, in comparison, preferred a more methodical approach; in 1962, he publicly questioned the purpose of “(hurrying) to get to the moon and the planets”, later warning that the space race “diverted a disproportionate share of (America’s) brainpower and research facilities” away from other critical national concerns. For Kennedy, however, this was not a diversion because to him, Apollo was of the highest priority. Koman (1994) mentions that he “obtained congressional support to double the space budget”; from then onward, NASA grew exponentially in order to meet the strict deadlines of Apollo imposed by Kennedy. In particular, its workforce grew to 36,000 in 1966 up from 10,000 six years earlier; the number of its outside contractors increased tenfold during that period. Kennedy’s decision here may have been warranted, as Werth (2004) argues that an American landing on the moon would serve as a “symbolic climax” of the Cold War power struggle, which he described as “epic”. He claimed that this ambitious plan was not simply about exploration but to assert America’s technological and ideological supremacy over the USSR.

However, once the U.S. achieved lunar dominance, NASA’s political and financial support gradually declined, and the agency began to struggle to justify its vast infrastructure built up during the 1960s. As Launius (2003) notes, NASA “built an enormous infrastructure to support Apollo for which future uses were limited”; Koman (1994) corroborates this claim, stating that “as the space program grew … in the 1970s, NASA began to feel a greater tightening of its budget belt, (since) the Soviets had been surpassed, and the international recognition of American ingenuity and technology was accomplished”. It is evident that NASA’s rapid expansion was intrinsically tied to Cold War geopolitics, and its eventual decline came because it had been so successful in the expensive Apollo program that there was not enough budget for further improvements and usage of its infrastructure.

*Conclusion*

The three studies conclusively show that the Cold War brought about NASA’s dramatic rise in the 1960s as it shaped its funding, priorities, and public perception. NASA was integrated deeply with Cold War politics—rather than simply to facilitate aerospace breakthroughs—and served as a battleground for ideological and technological supremacy between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, eventually leading to successful programs such as Apollo; however, NASA has faced a downturn in fortunes in the post-Cold War era.

Now, while existing literature and studies such as the ones analyzed in this review do provide important insights into NASA’s development during the Cold War, several questions still remain. First, to what extent did internal NASA decision-making influence its direction (independent of political pressures brought about by the Cold War)? Second, how did NASA officials navigate shifting political support in the rapidly changing landscape of the post-Apollo era? With this in mind, further research could examine the long-term consequences of Cold War-driven space policy on NASA’s later missions, including the Space Shuttle program. Investigating topics such as these could provide a more comprehensive and balanced understanding of NASA’s development and decline beyond the Cold War era.
