# About
Contains selected notes and work for some courses I'm taking in NUS High and NUS. Also contains general guidelines and revision tips. 

Most of the history coursework is typed and uploaded as Markdown (.md) files. For other subjects, the coursework is typically handwritten and scanned. Additional useful or relevant materials will also be uploaded when possible.

**Courses with uploaded materials:**
- History
