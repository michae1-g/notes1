# About
Contains selected notes, work, and other materials for some courses I'm taking in NUS High and NUS.

Most of the history coursework is typed and uploaded as Markdown (.md) files. For other subjects, materials are typically handwritten and scanned. Additional useful or relevant course-specific information will also be uploaded when possible.

**Courses with uploaded materials:**
- History
  - HY4131
  - HY4132
